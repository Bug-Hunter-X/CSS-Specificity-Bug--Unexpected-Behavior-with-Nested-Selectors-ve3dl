Several approaches can address this issue. The optimal solution depends on the specific context and desired behavior. The most common solutions involve:

1. **Increase Specificity:**  Further increase the specificity of the nested selector, perhaps by adding another unique class or ID.

2. **CSS Preprocessor:** Using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less can help manage CSS complexity and make it easier to avoid such issues. 

3. **!important:**  While generally discouraged, using `!important` within the problematic CSS rule will force the specific style to override other conflicting rules.

Here's a possible solution using increased specificity:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class {
  color: red;
}

#specific-id {
  color: green;
}

#specific-id.special-class {
  color: purple;
}

#specific-id.special-class .inner-div {
  color: yellow; /* Added a class .inner-div for better specificity */
}
```

Remember that using `!important` is a last resort and can negatively impact code maintainability.  Prioritizing well-structured CSS and employing techniques that enhance specificity usually provides superior, cleaner solutions.
