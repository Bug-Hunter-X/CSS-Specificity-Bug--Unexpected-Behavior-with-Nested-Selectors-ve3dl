The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue where the expected behavior doesn't occur due to unexpected specificity or cascading order:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class {
  color: red;
}

#specific-id {
  color: green;
}

#specific-id.special-class {
  color: purple; /* This should override both div and .special-class */
}

#specific-id.special-class div {
  color: yellow; /* This unexpectedly doesn't override #specific-id.special-class */
}
```

The `#specific-id.special-class div` selector, while seemingly more specific, fails to override the `#specific-id.special-class` selector. The expected outcome is for the nested div to be yellow. However, in some browsers or due to other CSS rules, it might not apply the yellow color. This could be due to order, or perhaps other rules that haven't been shown.
